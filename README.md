# Python Expense Tracker

A simple beginner-friendly **command-line Python app** that helps users track their expenses by category and date.  
This project was built as part of my Python learning journey to strengthen my fundamentals in file handling, functions, and loops.  

## Features
- Add expenses with category and amount  
- Save expenses into a text file (`expenses.txt`)  
- View total expenses by category  
- Record the date automatically for each expense  

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Make sure you have **Python 3+ installed**.  
3. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python expense_tracker.py

Enter expense (category, amount) or 'quit': food, 50
Enter expense (category, amount) or 'quit': transport, 30
Enter expense (category, amount) or 'quit': quit

Expenses by Category:
food: 50.0
transport: 30.0
Total: 80.0
